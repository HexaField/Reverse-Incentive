## The Project

The universe we find ourselves in is rather [complex](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cynefin_framework). Navigating the structures and systems that dictate how we operate as a civilisation is becoming [increasingly difficult](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LqaotiGWjQ). Reverse Incentive is a project designed to disambiguate and map [hyperobjects](https://www.hcn.org/issues/47.1/introducing-the-idea-of-hyperobjects), allowing us to have a better grasp of the [territory](https://fs.blog/2015/11/map-and-territory/).

## The architecture - open source data and collaboration

Github acts as an asynchronous collaboration tool, as well as a database / repository. Running a website off this repository that allows users to explore the data contained in this project. This is the broader intention - to make the data as user friendly, therefore as comprehensible, as possible.

The planned methodology is for the project maintainers to be the maintainers of the 'live' version (on the website). This repository can then be forked, and changes made into PRs as per the usual open source github workflow.

The data itself will be contained in JSON documents. There will need to be a large degree of experimentation and iteration to converge on an adequate data structure, though it should be largely as simple as adding arbitrary data and references to other documents. This can be thought of similar to how wikipedia works.

## Dialogue driven progress

Narratives have driven and pervaded civilisational progress across our history, and even pre-history, and has long sufficed. Though recent times have become increasingly complex and require a new form of epistomology. Using github's discussion functionality and REST api, an immutable discussion board can be linked to any data point, providing context, disagreements and deeper resources into the ideas in question.

## Scientifically rigirous, testable and simulatable

A well as discusion, all datapoints can be provided with external resources to provide evidence for, against, clearly displaying context and intent. Long term, the hopes for this project are to create models for systems and allow users tp run simulations to see how these systems react to changes. 

## The endpoint - data as a resource

Hosting an endpoint allows external tools to provider richer visaulisations.
